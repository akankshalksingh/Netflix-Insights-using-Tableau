## Description

The development of a comprehensive Tableau dashboard using a Kaggle dataset provides a powerful tool for industry decision-makers seeking to gain insights into key metrics related to Netflix content. The dashboard features a variety of visualizations, including maps, charts, and filters, offering users the ability to explore trends and patterns related to factors such as ratings, genres, release years, and more. With this dashboard, decision-makers can access up-to-date insights and use them to make data-driven decisions, optimizing their offerings and staying competitive in the rapidly-evolving media landscape.

1. The maps section of the dashboard displays the total number of movies and TV shows available on Netflix by country, with the United States having the highest number of titles. This can help users understand the global distribution of Netflix content and see which countries have the most and least content available.

2. The bar chart in the dashboard shows ratings from high to low, grouped by show ID from highest to lowest. This chart can help users understand which shows have the highest and lowest ratings on Netflix and how they compare to one another.

3. The bubble chart in the dashboard shows the count and percentage of total movies and TV shows on Netflix. This chart can help users understand the relative proportion of movies and TV shows on Netflix and how they have changed over time.

4. The bar chart in the dashboard displays the top 10 genres on Netflix. This chart can help users understand which genres are the most popular on Netflix and how they compare to one another.

5. The area chart in the dashboard shows the total number of movies and TV shows on Netflix by year. This chart can help users understand how the number of titles on Netflix has changed over time and identify any trends or patterns.

Once selected, the filter displays additional information about the selected title, including the release year, genre, rating, date added, duration, and description of the movie or TV show.
